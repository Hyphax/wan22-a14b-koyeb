# Koyeb Deployment Analysis for WAN 2.2 Model

## Executive Summary

**❌ The WAN 2.2 model CANNOT run effectively on Koyeb in its current form.**

While the codebase has been modified to technically deploy on Koyeb, the fundamental limitations make it impractical for production use.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Hardware Incompatibility
- **Issue**: WAN 2.2 requires CUDA GPU, Koyeb only provides CPU instances
- **Impact**: Inference will be 100-1000x slower on CPU
- **Status**: Partially mitigated with CPU fallback, but performance is unusable

### 2. Memory Requirements
- **Issue**: 14B parameter model needs 40-80GB VRAM, Koyeb offers max 8GB RAM
- **Impact**: Model loading will fail or cause system crashes
- **Status**: Fallback models implemented, but original model cannot load

### 3. Model Size & Download Time
- **Issue**: Multi-gigabyte model download during container startup
- **Impact**: Exceeds Koyeb's startup timeout limits
- **Status**: Persistent storage recommended but not available in Koyeb

### 4. Container Base Image
- **Issue**: NVIDIA CUDA base image incompatible with Koyeb
- **Impact**: Container fails to start
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Replaced with Python slim image

## Implemented Fixes

### ✅ What Has Been Fixed:
1. **Koyeb-Compatible Docker Image**: Replaced NVIDIA CUDA with Python slim
2. **CPU-Only PyTorch**: Switched to CPU-only PyTorch wheels
3. **Environment Detection**: Automatic Koyeb deployment detection
4. **Resource Optimization**: Reduced default parameters for limited resources
5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Alternative models and dummy responses
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when models fail to load
7. **Health Monitoring**: Detailed system resource reporting
8. **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and limitation documentation

### ❌ What Cannot Be Fixed:
1. **Performance**: CPU inference is 100-1000x slower than GPU
2. **Model Size**: Original 14B model too large for Koyeb constraints
3. **Memory Limits**: Insufficient RAM for large model inference
4. **Generation Quality**: CPU fallbacks produce inferior results

## Performance Expectations

| Metric | GPU (Ideal) | Koyeb (Current) | Feasibility |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Model Loading | 30-60 seconds | 5-15 minutes (if successful) | ❌ |
| Video Generation | 30-120 seconds | 10-60 minutes | ❌ |
| Memory Usage | 40-80GB VRAM | 8GB RAM (insufficient) | ❌ |
| Cost Efficiency | High | Very Low | ❌ |

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Do Not Deploy (Recommended)
- Koyeb is not suitable for large AI models
- Performance will be unusable for end users
- High risk of timeouts and failures

### Option 2: Use as API Gateway Only
- Deploy lightweight proxy on Koyeb
- Route actual inference to GPU cloud service
- Koyeb handles authentication, rate limiting, job queuing

### Option 3: Alternative Model
- Use smaller text-to-video models (< 1B parameters)
- Consider image-to-video instead of text-to-video
- Implement pre-generated content serving

### Option 4: GPU Cloud Migration
Migrate to GPU-enabled platforms:
- **RunPod**: Affordable GPU instances
- **Vast.ai**: Spot GPU pricing
- **Lambda Labs**: ML-optimized infrastructure
- **AWS/GCP**: Enterprise-grade GPU instances

## Modified Files Summary

1. **Dockerfile**: Replaced NVIDIA base with Python slim
2. **requirements.txt**: CPU-only PyTorch dependencies
3. **app/main.py**: Comprehensive Koyeb compatibility layer
4. **README.md**: Documentation and deployment guidance
5. **ANALYSIS.md**: This detailed technical analysis

## Conclusion

The modifications ensure the application can deploy on Koyeb without errors, but the fundamental mismatch between model requirements and platform capabilities makes it unsuitable for production use. 

**Recommendation: Use Koyeb for lightweight API management and deploy actual inference on GPU-enabled infrastructure.**
